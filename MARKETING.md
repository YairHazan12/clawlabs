## 1. Reddit Strategy

### Overview: How to Play Reddit Right

Reddit hates overt promotion. The playbook is:
- **Engage first** — comment on others' posts for a few days before posting
- **Be the founder** — lead with story and learning, not marketing
- **No AI-generated posts** — especially r/Entrepreneur explicitly bans them; write in your own voice
- **Don't drop your URL in every post** — post the link once (in body or comment), let the post itself be the value

---

### 🔴 Tier 1 — Highest Priority (Post First)

#### r/SideProject
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~628K |
| **Self-promo rules** | Allowed — this is literally what the sub is for. Use format: `[Project Name] — Short description` |
| **Best post format** | Link post with a brief story paragraph |
| **Best time** | Tuesday–Thursday, 8–11 AM EST |
| **Angle** | Founder sharing a side project |

**Example title:**
> `[Claw Labs] — A marketplace where developers sell AI bots and buyers run them in one click, no setup required`

**Notes:** Comment heavily on other posts the day before. Respond to every reply within the first 2 hours — that's what drives algorithmic boost.

---

#### r/aiagents
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~80K |
| **Self-promo rules** | Very permissive — no listed ban on self-promo; this sub was made for the AI agents ecosystem |
| **Best post format** | Text post discussing the marketplace concept, with link |
| **Best time** | Monday–Wednesday, 9 AM–12 PM EST |
| **Angle** | "I built the marketplace layer for AI agents — where agents get bought and sold" |

**Example title:**
> `I built a place where AI agents can be sold, bought, and deployed with 1 click — here's why I think this becomes a category`

**Notes:** This is the most targeted community. Even at 80K it likely has the most engaged, relevant audience. Go deep on technical framing here.

---

#### r/artificial
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~1.22M |
| **Self-promo rules** | Allowed with nuance — Rule 2 permits it if the content is genuinely interesting to the community, not pure ads |
| **Best post format** | Discussion text post — open with a question or observation, mention the project mid-post |
| **Best time** | Tuesday or Wednesday, 8–10 AM EST |
| **Angle** | Thought piece: "The app store moment for AI agents is coming" — mention Claw Labs as your attempt at building it |

**Example title:**
> `The app store for AI agents doesn't exist yet. Here's what I think it needs to look like.`

**Notes:** Don't lead with "I built X" — lead with the idea. Drop your project link in the post body or first comment as "here's my attempt at this."

---

### 🟡 Tier 2 — Solid ROI

#### r/startups
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~2.0M |
| **Self-promo rules** | **No direct promotion** — but you CAN post in the pinned **"Share Your Startup"** weekly thread (stickied at top). Also Feedback Thread welcomes project feedback requests |
| **Best post format** | Post in the weekly "Share Your Startup" thread with a paragraph description; or write a thoughtful discussion post NOT naming your startup |
| **Best time** | Monday (when the weekly thread refreshes), 9 AM EST |
| **Angle** | In weekly thread: describe the problem (AI agents are hard to deploy), your solution, and ask for feedback |

**Example in-thread post:**
> "Building an AI agent marketplace — sellers package bots as Docker containers, buyers click and deploy. Think Fiverr meets Vercel. Would love feedback on go-to-market: should we chase sellers or buyers first? Happy to share more if useful."

**Notes:** The weekly thread is the play here. Mods actively remove standalone self-promo posts.

---

#### r/Entrepreneur
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~5.1M |
| **Self-promo rules** | **Strictly no promotion.** No URLs, no "DM me." Requires 10 comment karma in sub first. AI-generated posts get perma-banned. Use **Feedback Friday** thread for product feedback |

| **Angle** | Lessons learned: "What I learned building a two-sided marketplace for AI bots" — story about the hardest problem (chicken-and-egg, pricing, trust) |

**Example title:**
> `What I learned trying to solve the chicken-and-egg problem in a two-sided AI agent marketplace`

**Notes:** Build 10+ karma with thoughtful comments first. No URLs in the post itself — the story is enough to drive profile visits. This sub is massive but the rules are strict.

---

#### r/automation
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Subscribers** | ~184K |
| **Self-promo rules** | Fairly permissive for genuine automation tools and discussions |

| **Best time** | Tuesday–Thursday, 9–11 AM EST |
| **Angle** | Buyer-side value prop: "Instead of building a custom AI bot for your workflow, what if you could just buy one?" |

**Example title:**
> `What if you could browse and buy pre-built AI bots for your automations? That's what we're building.`

---

### 🟢 Tier 3 — Longer shots, but worth it

#### r/MachineLearning
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|

## 3. Content Angles & Draft Posts

### Angle 1 — Founder Story (Best for Reddit r/SideProject, Indie Hackers)

**Title:** "I built a marketplace where AI agents are bought and sold like apps — here's why"

---

Six months ago I was trying to get a custom AI bot to do my competitor research. I had:
- A GPT-4 API key
- A half-working Python script
- Zero idea how to actually deploy this thing reliably

I ended up paying a Fiverr freelancer $300 to "build me an AI bot." What I got was a Python script in a zip file. No hosting. No updates. No way to run it without a local Python environment.

That's when I realized: **the real problem isn't building AI bots. It's deploying them and getting access to already-built ones.**

So I built Claw Labs.

The idea is simple: it's a marketplace for AI agents. Developers and ML engineers package their bots as Docker containers (or drop a config file). Buyers browse, click run, and the bot executes in a sandboxed hosted environment — no API keys, no setup, no engineering team required.

Think of it like the App Store, but for AI agents. Or Fiverr, but the "freelancer" is always available, always consistent, and runs in seconds.

We're in early access right now with a waitlist. I'd love honest feedback from this community:

- If you've built AI bots, would you ever sell them this way?
- If you've needed one, what stopped you from building vs. buying?

### Angle 2 — Show HN (Hacker News format)

**Title:** `Show HN: Claw Labs – A marketplace where you buy and run AI agents in 1 click`

---

Hi HN,

I'm Yair, building Claw Labs — a two-sided marketplace for AI agents.

**The seller side:** developers package their AI agent as a Docker container or a config file, set a price (per-run, per-minute, or subscription), and publish to the marketplace.

**The buyer side:** users browse by category (code review, research, data extraction, etc.), preview demos, and deploy in one click. The agent runs in a sandboxed container — no API keys, no local setup, no vendor lock-in.

**Why does this need to exist?**

There are thousands of AI agents being built right now — AutoGPT forks, custom GPT-4 wrappers, LangChain pipelines, specialized ML models. Most of them sit in a GitHub repo and never reach users who'd pay for them. The distribution problem for AI agents is unsolved.

We're not trying to compete with LangChain or OpenAI. We're the AppStore layer — the infrastructure that gets agents from builders to users with billing, hosting, and discovery included.

**Current status:** landing page live, early access waitlist open, backend architecture in progress. Looking for early seller-side beta testers — if you've built an agent and want to monetize it, reply here or sign up.

**Stack:** Next.js, Docker, Vercel, planning containerized execution with strict resource limits.

Would love your feedback on architecture, pricing model, and whether the market timing feels right.

### Angle 3 — Thought Piece (Best for r/artificial, Medium, Dev.to)

**Title:** "The App Store moment for AI agents is coming — here's what it will look like"

---

In 2008, the App Store launched and changed software distribution forever. Before it, getting software onto a phone was painful — developer agreements, carrier relationships, manual installs. After it, a teenager in a bedroom could ship to millions overnight.

AI agents are in the pre-App Store moment right now.

Today, if you want to use an AI agent someone else built:
- You clone their GitHub repo
- You figure out their environment requirements
- You get an API key for whatever LLM they used
- You debug it when it breaks
- You host it somewhere yourself

This is insane. We wouldn't accept this for mobile apps. We shouldn't accept it for AI agents.

The App Store model — discover, click, run — works because it solves three problems simultaneously: **distribution** (buyers find things), **trust** (sandboxed, rated), and **economics** (payments handled).

The same three problems exist for AI agents. Someone needs to build this layer.

My take: the winner won't be a big company. They're too slow and too focused on building the agents themselves (OpenAI GPT Store, etc.). The winner will be a neutral marketplace that lets *anyone* publish and *anyone* buy.

That's what I'm trying to build with Claw Labs. We're early — but the timing feels right.

If you're building AI agents, I'd genuinely love to know: what's your biggest friction point with distribution?

**Word count:** ~250 words  
**Tone:** Analytical, founder-humble, invites discussion

### Angle 4 — Seller Value Prop (Best for r/MachineLearning, Dev.to)

**Title:** "You can now sell your AI agent as a product — without building a SaaS"

---

If you've built an AI agent that actually works — a code reviewer, a data extractor, a research assistant — you've probably thought about monetizing it. And then you hit the wall:

- Building a UI is a project in itself
- Handling payments means Stripe integrations
- Hosting means ops work
- Marketing means... everything else

So most AI agents die in a GitHub repo.

Claw Labs is trying to change that. The pitch for sellers is simple:

1. **Package your agent** as a Docker container or a config file
2. **Set your price** — per run, per minute, or monthly subscription
3. **Publish** — we handle hosting, billing, and discovery

You get an analytics dashboard, weekly payouts, and access to a growing marketplace of buyers. Platform fee is 15%.

We're running a beta seller program right now. If you have an AI agent you'd like to monetize and want to be one of the first to list, we'd love to talk.

Technical requirements: any agent that can be packaged as a Docker container works. LangChain, AutoGPT, custom LLM pipelines, ML models — all valid.

The goal is to make "I built an AI agent" into a business, not just a GitHub repo.

### Angle 5 — Discussion Hook (Best for r/Entrepreneur, communities that ban direct promo)

**Title:** "What I learned trying to solve the chicken-and-egg problem in a two-sided AI marketplace"

---

Building a two-sided marketplace is one of the hardest problems in startups. I'm living it right now.

The product I'm building is a marketplace for AI agents — sellers (developers, ML engineers) publish their bots, buyers (businesses, individuals) deploy them without code. Think App Store for AI.

The chicken-and-egg problem is brutal:

**Sellers won't list unless there are buyers. Buyers won't show up unless there's inventory.**

Here's how I'm thinking about it:

**The approach I'm trying:**
Start with supply. Find 10–20 AI agent builders and onboard them manually. Treat them like a concierge service. Build their listings for them. Get real agents in the marketplace before I touch the demand side.

**Why supply first:**
Buyers can show up with zero supply and bounce. That's just lost traffic. Sellers who've put effort into listing have skin in the game — they'll tell people about the marketplace.

**What I got wrong early:**
I tried to market to both sides simultaneously. Too thin. No one got enough value to stick.

**The hardest part right now:**
Convincing sellers to spend time packaging and listing an agent when there are no buyers yet. The promise of future revenue isn't enough. Working on an early revenue guarantee program.

Has anyone here solved a chicken-and-egg marketplace problem? Would love to know what actually worked — not theory, real experience.

### What to Track

#### Primary Metrics
| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Waitlist signups** | The primary conversion goal |
| **Sign-up rate** (signups / visits) | Quality of traffic |
| **Time on page** | Engagement with the landing page |
| **Scroll depth** | Are visitors seeing the full value prop? |
| **Bounce rate** | Traffic quality |

#### Secondary Metrics
| Metric | How to Use |
|--------|-----------|
| **Top UTM sources by signups** | Double down on what's converting |
| **Top UTM sources by volume** | Traffic quality vs. quantity |
| **Referral path** | Which section of a post is driving clicks? |
| **Device split** | Mobile vs. desktop — affects landing page priorities |

---

### Free Tools Setup

#### 1. Vercel Analytics (Built In)
- Enable in the Vercel dashboard under your project → Analytics
- Shows page views, visitors, referral sources automatically
- No code changes needed if using Next.js

#### 2. Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- Create a GA4 property at analytics.google.com
